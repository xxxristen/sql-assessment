# Codecademy Learners Mockup Data - SQL Assessment
### Review questions

**1. What did you like about this project?**

The project allowed me to explore and revisited the SQL selections etc, knowledge that I've forgotten.

**2. What did you struggle with in this project?**

I encountered problems during the importation of users data to mySQl due to the conflicts between the data type that the column is supposed to carry vs the actual data contained in the column. This is a good lesson as a reminder that actual data might not be as per what the column is set to accept, so I should always check the data (when importing the data).


**3. What would make your experience with this assessment better?**

It'll be good to stick with the tool we were taught during the class. While I understand that it's normal to be exposed to tools that we are not taught, in the actual working world, I hope that for this assessment, we have the opportunity to test our knowledge using the tool that we are familiar with.
